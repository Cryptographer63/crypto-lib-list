- openabe: https://github.com/zeutro/openabe

  OpenABE is a cryptographic library that integrates a variety of attribute-based encryption (ABE) algorithms, industry-standard cryptographic features and tools, and an intuitive application programming interface (API). openABE is designed to allow developers to seamlessly incorporate ABE technology into applications that benefit from ABE to protect and control access to sensitive data. openABE is designed to be easy to use and does not require developers to be cryptographic experts.

- cpabe toolkit: https://acsc.cs.utexas.edu/cpabe/

  The cpabe toolkit provides a set of programs that implement a ciphertext policy-based attribute encryption scheme. It uses the PBC library for algebraic operations. Please note that cpabe toolkit may not compile for PBC versions above 0.5.4.

- Paillier Library: Advanced Crypto Software Collection

  Paillier is a public key cryptosystem that provides an additive homomorphism, making it useful for privacy-preserving applications. It is a simple GMP-based C library that implements the generation, encryption, and decryption of Paillier keys, and also makes the use of homomorphism easy.

- Proxy Re-cryptography Library: http://spar.isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/prl/

  Proxy Re-cryptography is a form of public key encryption that allows user Alice to "delegate" her decryption rights to another user, Bob. In a proxy re-encryption scheme, Alice delegates a semi-trusted proxy to translate the ciphertext encrypted under her key into the ciphertext encrypted under Bob's key. Once delegated, the agent operates independently of Alice. The proxy is considered "semi-trusted" because it cannot see the content of the translated message, nor can it re-encrypt Alice's message to a user to whom Alice has not granted decryption rights. This project is a C++ implementation of the proxy re-encryption scheme proposed in NDSS 2005 using the MIRACL library. Future versions of this library will incorporate the "proxy re-signature" scheme from CCS 2005.

- Broadcast Encryption: http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/bce/

  The Broadcast Encryption scheme allows a broadcaster to send an encrypted message to a set of receivers S, each of which has a different private key. Given any subset S' of S, the broadcaster can construct an encrypted message so that only the receivers in S' can decrypt it. This can be achieved by providing a pair of keys for each member of S. A copy of the message can then be encrypted separately under the key of each receiver in S'. However, this of course leads to very inefficient communication. The challenge is to construct a scheme in which the amount of communication is sublinearly related to the number of receivers. This project is an implementation of a BGW broadcast encryption scheme based on the PBC library.

Python

- pyUmbral: https://github.com/nucypher/pyUmbral

  pyUmbral is a reference implementation of the Umbral threshold proxy re-encryption scheme. It is open source, built in Python, and uses OpenSSL and Cryptography.io. Using Umbral, Alice (the data owner) can delegate the decryption of any ciphertext intended for her to Bob via a set of semi-trusted agents or re-encryption processes performed by Ursulas. when the thresholds of these agents are engaged by performing re encryption, Bob is able to combine these independent re-encryptions and decrypt the original message using his private key.
