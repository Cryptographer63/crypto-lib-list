# crypto-lib-list
Maintain a list([English](https://github.com/Cryptographer63/crypto-lib-list/blob/main/list/list-english.md), [Chinese](https://github.com/Cryptographer63/crypto-lib-list/blob/main/list/list-cn.md)) of open source libraries of cryptographic excellence

From 2020, it has always wanted to do a thing, that is, to do a cryptography open source project, do not expect to make much of a name for themselves, just want to exchange with everyone to learn. I built a cryptography R & D group, interested partners can join (you can private message me, you can also add me WeChatï¼ŒID:zsg123413345), to see if there is an opportunity for us to maintain an open source cryptography project together!
